# Confluence to Notion Converter

[Go to the project](https://github.com/devsisters/confluence-to-notion-converter)

This open-source software project implements a tool that transforms XML data backup files from the Confluence cloud so that users can import the existing contents into Notion.

This project is still under development, and there is still a lot of work to be done to verify, implement, and test the functionality.

A lot of sharing and participation will help the project progress.

Three parameters must be specified to run this tool.

- The `--input-xml-zip-file` switch must specify the file system path of the ZIP file containing the XML data created by the space export feature in the Confluence cloud. URLs are not supported.

- The `--confluence-domain` switch must specify the domain name of the Confluence cloud service. For example, if you have a team named `acme`, you should specify `acme.atlassian.net`.

- The `--output-html-zip-file` switch must specify the path to the ZIP file that will be created after conversion. If there is a file in the path, the execution of the program is stopped.
